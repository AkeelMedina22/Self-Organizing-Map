## About The Project

This is the third assignment from CS 451 Computational Intelligence offered at Habib University in Spring 2022.

The goal of the assignment is to take high-dimensional data from World Bank Data, and visualize a clustering through the use of Self Organizing Maps (SOM). A standard SOM has been created for which I applied Singular Value Decomposition to reduce the n-dimensional World Bank Data to a 3-dimensional RGB vector, which is then visualized using Tkinter.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

### Instructions:

Run main.py to generate Color Wall which depicts output of SOM clustering. Report is available in the Documentation folder.
